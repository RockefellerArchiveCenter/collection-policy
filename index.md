## Collecting Scope

The Rockefeller Archive Center’s acquisition efforts focus on collections documenting the broader history of philanthropy and other efforts to work on behalf of the public good. Because the means and methods of these activities are constantly evolving, the RAC’s overall collecting strategy and efforts will continuously evolve and remain flexible so as to reflect and document these changes.

Consistent with the RAC’s [Mission, Vision, and Values](https://rockarch.org/about-us/mission-vision-values/), the RAC has a particular interest in collecting materials related to philanthropy’s engagement with communities currently underrepresented in our collections. We aspire to undertake such collecting activities in a culturally competent manner to ensure that the relationship between the RAC and these communities is respectful and equitable.

The RAC collects a variety of formats including but not limited to paper documents, electronic and born-digital records, photographic media, audio, and moving images, while also considering the long-term preservation needs of the materials and our ability to be good stewards.

The RAC collects non-unique published resources in a limited way consistent with this Collection Policy and the [RAC Library Collection Management Policy](/library-policy/). 

Since we are primarily an archival repository and not a museum, we do not actively collect or accept artifacts or artwork. 

## Archival Appraisal Prior to Acquisition

Records are selected for acquisition by the RAC through the process of archival appraisal. Appraisal constitutes an evaluation of records to determine whether the materials being considered for acquisition have enduring or permanent informational value within the RAC’s collecting scope as defined by this policy. 

Once materials have been appraised, legally transferred to, and accessioned into the RAC’s collections, they are considered archival. Archival records are those that are no longer actively used by the creator, are or will be open and available for public use, are authentic, and have enduring historical or informational value. 

## Reappraisal and Deaccessioning

From time to time, the RAC evaluates and strengthens the integrity and cohesion of its archival collections within the framework of the RAC’s approved Collection Policy through the process of [Reappraisal](https://docs.rockarch.org/reappraisal-policy). 

Deaccessioning, or the process by which the RAC permanently removes previously accessioned materials from its holdings, is done in accordance with the RAC’s [Deaccession Policy](/deaccession-policy).
